<h2>Cleaning and Profiling</h2>
We have meticulously cleaned and profiled each dataset to ensure data quality and accuracy. This process involved handling missing values, correcting data types, and addressing any inconsistencies in the datasets.

<h2>Individual Analyses</h2>

  <h4>Electricity Consumption Analysis</h4>
  Summary of key findings and insights obtained from analyzing the 'Electricity Consumption' dataset.
  
  <h4>Electricity Rates Analysis</h4>
  Summary of key findings and insights obtained from analyzing the 'Electricity Rates' dataset.
  
  <h4>Electric Vehicles Purchase Analysis</h4>
  Summary of key findings and insights obtained from analyzing the 'Electric Vehicles Purchase' dataset.

<h2>Data Merging</h2>
We have combined the three datasets by mapping the data into regions. The merging process involved aggregating values for each region from the years 2016 to 2021.

<h2>Merged Analysis</h2>
A comprehensive analysis has been conducted on the merged dataset to identify potential linear correlations between different variables. This integrated approach provides a holistic view of the relationships between electricity consumption, rates, and electric vehicle purchases across regions.

<h2>How to Use</h2>
Instructions on how to replicate the analysis, including any dependencies or software requirements.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
A brief summary of the overall findings and potential implications of the analyses.
